# AgriGuard Backend üåæüõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to AgriGuard Backend! This repository serves as the backend component of the AgriGuard project, which aims to revolutionize agricultural practices in India by leveraging AI/ML and modern web technologies to empower farmers with timely insights and decision-making support.

## Description

In India, agricultural productivity suffers from the absence of monitoring, knowledge gaps, and insufficient decision-making support. Integrating IoT for real-time monitoring, enhancing accessibility to modern agricultural practices, and deploying AI/ML-driven decision support systems can empower farmers with timely insights, knowledge, and tools, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable crop cultivation.

Our backend component plays a crucial role in handling operations, data processing, and machine learning tasks. It utilizes Python and Flask to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure, while also integrating with machine learning algorithms for data analysis and optimization.
